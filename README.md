Goal:
-----------------
Create a simple working tic tac toe game that plays vs a smart playing
computer. Implement a text version, then a GUI mouse clickable version.

Summary:
-----------------
This project was a revamp of one of the first large projects I ever attempted in
C++. I was able to take it a few steps further and make the AI cleaner, more 
object oriented, and I designed a clean GUI for playing. 

More wanted features:
-----------------
* Fill the letter to the size of the tile.
* Highlight the winning row at the end of the game.
* Enable support for scoring larger tictactoe boards (4x4 - 10x10)
* Add a menu - with File, Newgame, exit, Help, credits, etc.
