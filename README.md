Summary:
-----------------
This project was a revamp of one of the first large projects I ever attempted in
C++. I was able to take it a few steps further and make the AI cleaner, more 
object oriented, and I designed a clean tkinter GUI for playing. 

### Prerequisities
Python 3

## Running:
### Console run
``` 
$ python3 main <mode>
```
mode is either 'console' or 'gui' depending on which interface you want to use.
